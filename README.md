## Clipboard Saver
Save the contents of your clipboard to a csv for later reference.

## Is this a good idea?
No, not really.
Think carefully about the sensitive and privet information that you copy all the time...
If you do use this, resist the urge to make the output available on the cloud.

To make this more safe, adjust the code to only save specific types of data such as phone numbers, addresses, etc

## Why you might find this useful:
If you know that in the background everything you copy is saved, you can purposely copy things to save them for later. Addresses, phone numbers, jokes, a link to something to look at later, etc.

The 3rd column of the output csv will characterize (if we can recognize it) what the data is so you can filter.
I hope to build on this in a big way. If we know exactly what the data copied is, we can make the filtering to exclude sensitive data better, add better filtering, and treat data differently. For example, we could keep a file for just phone numbers etc.

## How to make this even better:
Share your clipboard across all your devices!
Now you only need one computer running the script and you can send things to the file from your phone!
Besides, copying an address on your computer and than pasting it on your phone is useful, awesome, and the inspiration behind this project.
